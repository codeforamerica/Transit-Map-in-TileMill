#Hi!

These are the style and data files that make up the transit map built for Macon, Georgia during its 2012 [Code for America](http://www.codeforamerica.org) partnership. The Macon Transit Athority now uses it on their [website](http://www.mta-mac.com/map.html).

You can also view a large version [here](http://tiles.mapbox.com/jllord/map/mta). You can view a medium-sized version with a fun CSS legend [here](http://codeforamerica.github.com/Transit-Map-in-TileMill/). So many options.

##We <3 Open Source

Everything we do is open source, so take it and use it! If you have a city that is exactly like Macon - same streets, same boundaries, same bus routes - you'll find this very useful! If not, it may still be useful to check out how it was styled.

##More

If you have more questions - let [jllord](http://www.twitter.com/jllord) know.

Also, the extra javascript and bus-times awesomeness that [Nick](http://www.github.com/mapmeld) made for the final map on the City's website is on [this repo](http://www.github.com/codeforamerica/Transit2Me).

The slides from my talk at State of the Map US in 2012 are in this repo.
